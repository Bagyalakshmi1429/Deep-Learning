# Deep-Learning
A collection of deep learning concepts and models that I have explored and experimented with. The concepts covered in this repository include Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), You Only Look Once (YOLO), VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet, LASSO, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, Regularization, Dropout Ratio, Loss Function, Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

Each concept is accompanied by code implementations and detailed explanations to help understand the underlying principles and applications. Through this repository, I aim to provide a comprehensive resource for those interested in delving into the intricacies of deep learning, and to foster a better understanding of the diverse range of models and techniques within the field of artificial intelligence."
